- [ ] **Dynamic population density scaling**
  - Scale overlay city boundaries by population density ratio
  - Auto-calculate scaling factor based on base vs overlay population density
  - Example: LA overlay on NYC base would shrink to ~0.45x size due to lower density
  - Example: NYC overlay on LA base would expand to ~2.2x size due to higher density

- [ ] **Visual scaling feedback**
  - Show scaling ratio in UI (e.g., "LA scaled to 0.45x for NYC density")
  - Display population density comparison statistics
  - Toggle between area comparison and density comparison modes
  - Clear visual indication when density scaling is active

- [ ] **Enhanced comparison metrics**
  - Show people per square mile for both cities
  - Calculate and display effective area at same density
  - Population-to-area ratio visualizations
  - Density-based color coding or visual indicators

2. **Set up development environment** with modern tooling
3. **Prototype gesture controls** on current MVP
4. **Research and curate** initial 100-city dataset
5. **Design Claude API integration** architecture

## Epic 7: Architecture Optimization & Data Reorganization üèóÔ∏è
**Priority: HIGH (Before scaling to 500+ cities)**

### Phase 7.1: File Organization & Data Structure
- [ ] **Directory restructuring**
  - Move 233+ boundary files from root to organized structure (`data/boundaries/continent/country/`)
  - Consolidate 92 backup files into dedicated backup directory
  - Separate databases into `data/databases/` folder
  - Organize Python scripts into `scripts/core/`, `scripts/utilities/` structure

- [ ] **Path management system**
  - Create centralized path configuration module
  - Update all scripts to use dynamic path resolution
  - Regional organization by continent/country for scalability
  - Consistent file naming conventions

### Phase 7.2: Script Consolidation & Process Management
- [ ] **Reduce script redundancy**
  - Consolidate 6 different boundary downloaders into unified system
  - Merge 5 boundary fixers into single intelligent processor
  - Combine 4 statistics gatherers into one comprehensive manager
  - Keep `unified_city_boundary_pipeline.py` as primary processor

- [ ] **Background process coordination**
  - Implement process manager to track running background tasks
  - Prevent file conflicts during batch operations
  - Safe migration strategy that respects active processes
  - Process status monitoring and coordination tools

### Phase 7.3: Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Data optimization**
  - Remove unused large files (14MB `la-county-boundaries.geojson`)
  - Implement GeoJSON compression (70-80% size reduction potential)
  - Lazy loading for boundary data in web interface
  - Browser-side caching for frequently accessed boundaries

- [ ] **Database management**
  - Consider SQLite for complex queries at 500+ city scale
  - Implement versioning for database updates
  - Atomic updates and validation scripts
  - RESTful API layer for boundary data retrieval

### Phase 7.4: Migration Strategy (4-Phase Safe Implementation)
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Prepare infrastructure (create directories, path config) - SAFE
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Gradual file migration (coordinate with background processes) - CAREFUL
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Script consolidation (after file reorganization) - MAJOR
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Performance optimization (lazy loading, compression) - ENHANCEMENT

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation**:
- **High Risk**: 10+ background processes may fail if files moved improperly ‚Üí Monitor processes before migration
- **Medium Risk**: HTML files have hardcoded relative paths ‚Üí Implement path resolver first
- **Low Risk**: Database consistency ‚Üí Atomic updates, validation scripts
