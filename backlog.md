  - Research top 100 cities by population, economic importance
  - Download high-quality boundary data for each
  - Standardize data format and quality
  - Create city metadata (population, area, country, etc.)

- [ ] **Search-based city selection**
  - Replace dropdowns with searchable input fields
  - Autocomplete with city suggestions
  - Filter by country, region, population
  - Recent/favorite cities list

### Phase 2.2: City Data Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] **Optimized data loading**
  - Lazy loading of boundary data
  - Compressed GeoJSON storage
  - CDN integration for faster delivery
  - Client-side caching strategy

- [ ] **City information display**
  - Population and area statistics
  - Country/region context
  - Data source attribution
  - Last updated timestamps

## Epic 3: Intelligent Data Sourcing ü§ñ

### Phase 3.1: Claude API Integration
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] **Dynamic city data discovery**
  - Claude API calls for city not in database
  - Intelligent source identification (OpenStreetMap, government data)
  - Automated data quality assessment
  - Source reliability scoring

- [ ] **Automated data acquisition**
  - API calls to retrieve boundary data
  - Data format validation and conversion
  - Quality checks and error handling
  - User notification of data availability

### Phase 3.2: Data Processing Pipeline
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] **Real-time data processing**
  - GeoJSON validation and cleanup
  - Coordinate system standardization
  - Simplification for web performance
  - Caching of processed results

- [ ] **User feedback integration**
  - Data quality reporting
  - Missing city requests
  - Boundary accuracy feedback
  - Community-driven improvements

## Epic 4: Enhanced User Experience üé®

### Phase 4.1: UX/UI Improvements
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] **Intuitive onboarding**
  - Interactive tutorial for gestures
  - Example comparisons showcase
  - Progressive feature disclosure
  - Help system integration

- [ ] **Advanced comparison features**
  - Multiple overlay support (compare 3+ cities)
  - Comparison history and bookmarks
  - Share comparison URLs
  - Export comparison images

### Phase 4.2: Performance & Accessibility
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - WebGL rendering for large datasets
  - Progressive loading strategies
  - Memory management improvements
  - Frame rate optimization

- [ ] **Accessibility compliance**
  - Screen reader support
  - Keyboard navigation
  - High contrast mode
  - Reduced motion preferences

## Epic 5: Technical Infrastructure üîß

### Phase 5.1: Architecture Redesign
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] **Modern tech stack**
  - Consider React/Vue for component-based UI
  - State management for complex interactions
  - TypeScript for better code quality
  - Build system for optimization

- [ ] **API backend development**
  - Node.js/Express server for Claude API integration
  - Database for city metadata and caching
  - Rate limiting and error handling
  - Authentication for API usage

### Phase 5.2: DevOps & Deployment
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline**
  - Automated testing suite
  - Performance regression testing
  - Deployment automation
  - Environment management

- [ ] **Monitoring & analytics**
  - User behavior tracking
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error reporting
  - Usage analytics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. UX mockup creation with gesture interactions
2. Touch/gesture event handling implementation
3. Mobile-responsive UI redesign
4. Basic search interface for cities

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
1. Implement 100-city database
2. Search and autocomplete functionality
3. Enhanced gesture controls
4. Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 5-6)
1. Claude API integration
2. Dynamic data sourcing
3. Automated data processing
4. User feedback systems

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
1. Advanced features and UI polish
2. Accessibility improvements
3. Performance tuning
4. Testing and bug fixes

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent comparing cities, return visits
- **Gesture Adoption**: Percentage of users using touch/gesture controls
- **City Coverage**: Number of successful city requests beyond the initial 100
- **Performance**: Load times, frame rates, mobile responsiveness
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation

## Technical Considerations
